FileMover Pumps
===============

The two FileMover pumps are primarily meant to serve as simple 
examples of how to write your own pump types.  There is both a
:ref:`Simple File Mover <pump_type-simplefilemover>` which simply
moves all files from one directory to another, and a slightly more
complex :ref:`File Mover <pump_type-filemover>` which allows you to
filter based on file patterns, and iterate through subdirectories.
