QATrack+ Generic File Uploads
=============================

QCPump currently has two pumps for uploading text or binary files
to QATrack+.  Both pumps operate by watching a directory for files,
uploading them to a QATrack+ test list, and optionally, moving the
file to a new directory after the file is processed.
