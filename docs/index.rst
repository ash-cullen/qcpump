QCPump is an extensible utility for extracting data from various sources
(databases, filesystem etc) and moving it to other locations.  The primary use
of QCPump is currently for extracting data from SNC Daily QA3 databases
(Firebird & Atlas) and uploading it to QATrack+ via QATrack+'s API.

QCPump currently includes the following Pump Types:

    * :ref:`Simple File Mover & File Mover <pump_type-filemovers>` which
      serve as examples for writing your pump types.

    * :ref:`FirebirdDQA3 & AtlasDQA3 <pump_type-filemovers>` which can be used
      for retrieving Daily QA3 data from Firebird & Atlas (SQLServer)
      databases.
