QCPump
======

QCPump is an extensible utility for extracting data from various sources
(databases, filesystem etc) and moving it to other locations.  Currently the
primary use of QCPump is for extracting data from SNC Daily QA3 databases
(Firebird & Atlas), Varian MPC results files and other file types (coming
soon), and uploading it to QATrack+ via QATrack+'s API.
